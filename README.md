# RISC-V_Pipelined_Processor
We tackled the challenge of designing a fast and reliable RISC-V processor. Pipelining lets it run instructions in parallel, but that creates some tricky problems. We solved those problems, known as hazards, to ensure the processor can execute instructions efficiently and without errors.
